Prawn Peri Peri

Peri Peri also called Piri Piri or Pili Pili is an African birds eye chilli and the name is derived from a Swahili word which means ‘pepper pepper’. Late 14 Century when the Portugese explorers set sail for the east in quest of spices they stumbled upon these fiery hot chillies in Africa. Peri Peri as a sauce or marinade that we know today, was created in Mozambique by Portugese settlers. Subsequently it travelled to other parts of Africa and then rest of the world. The original recipe consists of ‘Piri Piri’ chilli, garlic, lemon juice and oil. Goan recipes also include a generous dose of spices adding a very unique Indian flavor and dimension to it. Today Peri Peri has become a popular marination for Barbecued or grilled chicken and shrimp recipes. So here is my recipe for making a perfect Peri Peri prawn.
